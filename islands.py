# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
# islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
# island_counter(islands) # returns 4

# islands
# connected
# directoins, nsew
# 2d array
# returns (shape of solution)

# How can we find the extent of an island
# Either of our travels to find all of the nodes in an island

# How do I explore the larder set?
# Loop thorough and call a traversal if we find an alternative
